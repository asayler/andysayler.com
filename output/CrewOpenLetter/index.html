Update: It looks as though the
<a href="http://president.tufts.edu/2012/05/letter-to-mens-crew-team/">
suspension has been rescinded</a>.
Thank you to
<a href="http://president.tufts.edu/">President Monaco</a>
for intervening and helping to resolve the situation.

Edit: I have updated this letter to address it to both Dean Reitman
and Director of Rowing, Gary Caldwell.
<a href="http://blogs.tuftsdaily.com/?p=4970">Recent reports</a>
indicate that
the suspension may have been an internal decision as opposed to a
top-down decision. Regardless, I still strongly disagree with the
decision to suspend the team for the reasons outlined below and request
that whoever has the power to do so reverse the decision immediately.

<p>
Dear 
<a href="mailto:gary.caldwell@tufts.edu">Director Caldwell</a> and
<a href="mailto:deanofstudentaffairs@ase.tufts.edu">Dean Reitman</a>,
</p>

<p>
I am a recent Tufts Alum, having graduated Magna Cum Laude with a
Bachelors of Science in Electrical Engineering last year. During my
time at Tufts, I served as the
the General Manager of WMFO from 2009 through 2011 and counted
a number of Tufts rowers among my close friends and associates.
I am now pursing
my doctorate in Computer Science at the University of Colorado.
</p>

<p>
I recently became aware of the suspension of a number of members of
the <a href="http://www.gotuftsjumbos.com/sports/mcrew/index">
Tufts Men's crew team</a> in relation to an incident involving their
selection of custom jerseys for last weekend's Spring Fling event as
reported in the
<a href="http://blogs.tuftsdaily.com/?p=4970">
May 2nd issue of the Tufts Daily</a>.
I am writing to
express my disappointment and disagreement with
the decision to suspend these individuals,
and to request that you reconsider or overrule this decision.
</p>

<p>
The
<a href="http://boston.3432.voxcdn.com/files/2012/05/tuftss-477x640.jpg">
jerseys in question</a> displayed the phrase "check out our cox" above
a standard image of a coxswain piloted crew boat. Having run a
broadcast FM radio station for two years, I am more familiar than most
with the standards our society applies when classifying obscene and
offensive material, as well as the means by which we arrive at such
standards. In general, our society operates under the idea that speech
must be considered offensive by a protected member of the expected
audience in order to forfeit the right to free expression. This is why
the late <a href="http://www.georgecarlin.com/">George Carlin</a>
can <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_dirty_words">
say "fuck" on television</a>
after 10PM at night
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watershed_(television)#United_States">
but not during the day</a>. I do not believe that the jersey design
in question would be reasonably found to be offensive by a member of
the audience at a typical Spring Fling event. There may be many
instances in which such jerseys would not be appropriate, but Spring
Fling is not one of them.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, matters of offense are highly subjective. We have a duty
to insure that all reasonable complaints are investigated and
considered. But we also have a duty to
<a href="http://thefire.org/article/14449.html">
uphold the rights</a> of the accused.
Due to the highly subjective nature of matters of offense, it
is very important that judgment be passed not by an individual, but by
a jury of peers. Those wishing to register complaints should have the
opportunity to do so, but the proper response to these complaints
should be decided by the <a href="http://tcuj.tufts.edu/">TCUJ</a>
or a similar student body, not by the
Office of Student Affairs, the Athletic department, or the team's coach.
Membership on a athletic team does not forfeit one's right to free expression,
especially while taking part in activities that are not sponsored by the team.
The members of the men's crew team should
be given adequate opportunity to defend their right to free
expression. They should be treated as innocent until their peers find
them guilty. They should not be suspended for subjectively offensive
actions on the basis of a single set of complaints at the judgment of
a single office or individual.
</p>

<p>
Most importantly, this suspension is a disservice to those of us that
fight daily against a wide range of truly offensive, misogynistic
material that supports a cultural acceptance of sexual violence and
rape. As I write this letter, numerous individuals are responding to
this suspension with attacks on feminism, Tufts feminists, and those
of us that work to combat the pervasive culture of rape on college
campuses. These retaliatory attacks against
<a href="http://boston.barstoolsports.com/random-thoughts/reader-email-did-tufts-feminists-get-the-mens-crew-team-suspended-for-wearing-check-out-our-cox-shirts-to-spring-fling-that-supposedly-supported-rape-culture/">
"batshit crazy feminists and delusional school administrators"</a>
are inappropriate and
misplaced. They are also highly detrimental to everything for which we
stand, far more detrimental than the jersey in question. Suspending
members of the men's crew team for a jersey that neither threatens nor
implies any non-consensual sexual actions, let alone rape, only
lessens our ability to strongly punish those who do threaten and imply
such actions.
</p>

<p>
I am a proud Tufts Alum, an adamant feminist, and an individual with
(colloquially) a cock. I request that you rescind the
decision to suspend these individuals and defer the complaints you
have received to the TCUJ or other student-led arbitration body for
due process. Not doing so is a disservice to our school, to the
fundamental rights of those involved, and to the true fight against
the misogynistic rape culture that is currently profiting from these
actions.
</p>

<p>
Sincerely Yours,<br />

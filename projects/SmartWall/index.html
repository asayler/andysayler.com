<h1>SmartWall Technology</h1>
</header>
<p>
  SmartWall Technology is a business idea and associated technology
  that I have been working on in various capacities since 2010. The
  project started as my senior design project at
  <a href="http://www.tufts.edu">Tufts University</a>
  and was undertaken in conjunction with my teammates
  <a href="https://plus.google.com/115042432272438126776">
    Laura Costello</a> and
  <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/patrick-mckelvy/25/b18/647">
    Patrick McKelvy</a>.
</p>
<p>
  More recently, I have been working on the project on my own time
  with CU Law student
  <a href="http://www.greenwin.com/AdamG.shtml">Adam Gianola</a>.
  We have used the project as
  the basis for our entry in the 2012
  <a href="http://www.cunvc.org">CU New Venture Challenge</a>
  Start-up Competition.

<h2>SmartWall Concept</h2>
</header>
<p>
  SmartWall Technology aims to build a standardized system for the
  monitoring, control, and automation of home and office electrical
  systems. This system will replace the current use of ‘dumb’ electrical
  interfaces (standard outlets, light fixtures, appliances, etc.) with
  networked, switchable, programmable counterparts. The new system will
  be affordable, retrofittable, open, and extensible. It will allow for
  Web-based remote energy monitoring, control, and automation on a fine
  grain, per- device level. It will also allow for the creation of
  intelligent automation schemes that can increase the energy efficiency
  of a building’s electrical system. The open and extensible nature of
  the system will allow third-parties to develop apps offering
  additional functionality as well as allowing device manufacturers to
  directly implement the technology in their products.

  <h1>Contact Andy</h1>
</header>

<p>
  Every now and again, someone finds it necessary to contact me.
  Occasionally, they find it both necessary to contact me, and devoid
  of any means for doing so. If you currently find yourself in that
  situation, hopefully this page will provide the information you
  need. If not, I don't quite know what to tell you, since the only
  way to get more information on how to contact me, is to contact me
  in the first place. Nuts.

  <h2>Security</h2>
</header>

<p>
  If you would like to contact me securely, your best bet is to hit my
  up on <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> (assuming you have my
  number). You can also find
  my <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/">GPG</a> public key
  (0xF613E73432C59C00) on various public key-servers like
  <a href="https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?search=0xF613E73432C59C00&fingerprint=on&op=index">keyserver.ubuntu.com</a>. But
  let's face it -- no one really wants to use GPG if they can avoid
  it. I'm also on <a href="https://keybase.io/asayler">KeyBase</a>,
  but don't frequently check those messages.

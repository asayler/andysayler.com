  <h2>Background</h2>
</header>

<p>
  I hold both a PhD and MS in
  <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/cs/">Computer Science</a>
  from the
  <a href="https://www.colorado.edu">University of Colorado,
  Boulder</a>. My <a href="/output/">research work</a> sits at the
  intersection of security, privacy, and public policy and often deals
  with hard problem related to third party trust and secure secret
  storage.
</p>

<p>
  Prior to coming to Boulder, I obtained my
  Bachelors of Science in
  <a href="https://engineering.tufts.edu/ece/">Electrical Engineering</a>
  from <a href="https://www.tufts.edu/">Tufts University</a> in
  Medford, MA. I have a minor in
  <a href="https://engineering.tufts.edu/cs">Computer Science</a>,
  and lots of coursework in
  <a href="https://engineering.tufts.edu/me/">Mechanical Engineering</a>
  and <a href="/photography/">Photography</a>
</p>

<p>
  I like the
  number <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_(number)">3</a>,
  enjoy Internet and Tech history, and appreciate a wide variety of
  music, but especially Sisters of Mercy, Nirvana, and anything
  involving Jack White. I also like to dance, practice
  <a href="/photography/">photography</a>, and fly kites. This
  sentence exists merely to satisfy the first item in this paragraph.

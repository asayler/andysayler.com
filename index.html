  <h1>Andy's Little Website</h1>

<p>
  Hi. I'm Andy Sayler, and <a href="/">this</a> is my personal webspace.
  See that
  picture to the left? That's me (or at least my comic alter ego). You
  can access various information related to me or some of my work via that
  little link bar near the top of the screen.
</p>
<p>
  Maybe you want to learn a little bit <a href="/about">about me</a>?
  You can do that. It's part of the point of this site.
  Or maybe you'd rather see some of the <a href="/projects">projects</a>
  I am (or have been) involved with? That's okay here too.
</p>
<p>
  Not what you were looking for? To each her own... Maybe you'd rather
  view some of my
  <a href="/output">public work</a> (published or otherwise)?
  Or maybe you just want to look at <a href="/photography">some pictures</a>?
  Have some spare time? I encourage you to do both.
</p>
<p>
  Still no luck navigating the site? Here are
  <a href="/bits">some things</a> I like
  on the Interwebs and elsewhere. Take a look. And here's a
  <a href="/resume">socially acceptable form of bragging</a>
  about my prior exploits. Maybe you will find it helpful.
</p>
<p>
  Sometimes people like to give me money (or trade in-kind) to do things
  that they believe I am skilled at. If that sounds like something you'd
  be interested in trying, take a look
  over <a href="/hire">here</a>. Or maybe you just want to
  <a href="/contact">contact</a> me. If that's the case, then I apologize for
  making you come all the way down here: the bottom of the page. Maybe I
  should have offered that option sooner? I'll make a note...
</p>
<p>
  This site changes sometimes, and tends to be constantly under
  construction. Make sure to check back in every now and then to
  see what's changed. Also, doing so will make me feel better about
  all of the graphs that my analytics software likes to show me. And
  since I sometime beta test things here (and don't always know what
  I'm doing), make sure to let me know if you have any problems
  related to the site.

  <h1>About Andy</h1>
</header>

<p>
  So you want to know more about me? Let's see what we can do...  I'm
  an Engineer with EE, ME, and CS tendencies. I like building things
  that people can use. I also enjoy various (debatably)
  non-engineering pursuits (like
  <a href="/photography">photography</a>).
</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
</header>

<p>
  When not discharging my duties as a masked vigilante, I'm
  a <a href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/">Computer Science</a> PhD
  student at the
  <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/">University of Colorado</a> in
  Boulder. I'm working with the
  <a href="http://systems.cs.colorado.edu/">System and Networks</a>
  group on next generation networking technology, digital security,
  and various other projects I find interesting.
</p>

<p>
  Prior to coming to Boulder, I obtained my
  Bachelors of Science in
  <a href="http://www.ece.tufts.edu/">Electrical Engineering</a>
  from <a href="http://www.tufts.edu/">Tufts University</a> in
  Medford, MA. I have a minor in
  <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/">Computer Science</a>,
  and lots of coursework in
  <a href="http://engineering.tufts.edu/me/">Mechanical Engineering</a>
  and <a href="/photography">Photography</a>
</p>

<p>
  Despite my current computer science tendencies, I very much consider
  myself an engineer (not that they are mutually exclusive; I'm just
  not
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_computation">this kind</a>
  of Computer Scientist).
  I'm happiest when building things that solve
  interesting problems. In particular, problems in the consumer/commercial
  software, electronics, and devices space.
  In short, I like building things that
  one could conceivably go out, buy, and benefit from.
</p>

<p>
  While predicting the future is a dangerous pursuit, I would wager
  that my future will include some form of R&amp;D work combining my
  EE, and CS talents (and maybe ME talents too).  I'm interested in
  entrepreneurship and would love to build something interesting
  enough that it would warrant starting a company to develop and sell.
</p>

<p>
  I like the number 3, enjoy Internet and Tech history, and appreciate
  a wide variety of music, but especially early goth rock,
  David Bowie, and The White Stripes. I also Swing Dance, practice
  <a href="/photography">photography</a>, and fly kites.  This
  sentence exists merely to satisfy the first item in this paragraph.
